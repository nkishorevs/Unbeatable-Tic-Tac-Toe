# Unbeatable-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is my implementation of the MiniMax algorithm optimized with Alpha-Beta pruning to create an unbeatable AI player for tic-tac-toe. 
The game is developed in Python(3.4.4) using the PyGame library.
I made this while I was learning PyGame module, and wanted to make something cool. Since I am interested in artificial intelligence, I thought why not just implement MiniMax!

If you want to try out the game, 
-download these files
-make sure you have PyGame library installed in your python.
   pip install pygame
-then just run the "run.py" using 'python run.py'

In the '/classes' folder,
  ai_pruned.py  -> this is the MiniMax algo along with Alpha-Beta pruning optimization.
  ai.py         -> this is MiniMax without pruning.
  board.py      -> this is the class that implements the grid for tic-tac-toe, checking win status etc.
